        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
          SearchAI was founded in 2021 by two tech enthusiasts, Emily Johnson
          and Michael Smith. With a shared passion for artificial intelligence
          and a vision to make information accessible to everyone, they embarked
          on a journey to create an innovative AI-powered search engine. Their
          goal was simple: to provide users with the most accurate and
          comprehensive answers to their questions in real-time.
